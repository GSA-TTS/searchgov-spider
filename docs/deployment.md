# Deplolyment
We use AWS CodePipeline to deploy the spider application as does the rest of the search application.  To deploy in AWS see the documents under CodePipeline.  Toward the pivot to Jemison we investigated if we could continue using this spider application in Cloud.gov.  As part of that investigation we added the capability to deploy to cloud.gov.
