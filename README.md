## About
With the move away from using Bing to provide search results for some domains, we need a solution that can index sites that were previously indexed by Bing and/or that do not have standard sitemaps.  Additionally, the Scrutiny desktop application is being run manually to provide coverage for a few dozen domains that cannot be otherwise indexed.  The spider application is our solution to both the Bing problem and the removal of manual steps.  The documentation here represents the most current state of the application and our design.

### Technologies
We currently run python 3.12.  The spider is based on the open source [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) framework.  On top of that we use several other open source libraries and scrapy plugins.  See our [requirements file](search_gov_crawler/requirements.txt) for more details.

### Core Scrapy File Structure
*Note: Other files and directories are within the repository but the folders and files below relate to those needed for the scrapy framework.

```bash

│   ├── domains                     # json files with domains to scrape
│   ├── elasticsearch               # code related to indexing content in elasticsearch

## Quick Start

1. Insall and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install required python modules:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# required for domains that need javascript
playwright install --with-deps
playwright install chrome --force
```

3. Run A Spider:
```bash
cd search_gov_crawler

# to run for a non-js domain:
scrapy crawl domain_spider -a allowed_domains=quotes.toscrape.com -a start_urls=https://quotes.toscrape.com -a output_target=csv

# or to run for a js domain
scrapy crawl domain_spider_js -a allowed_domains=quotes.toscrape.com -a start_urls=https://quotes.toscrape.com/js -a output_target=csv
```

4. Check Output:

The output of this scrape is one or more csv files containing URLs in the [output directory](search_gov_crawler/output).

## Entrypoints
* [Scrapy Scheduler](search_gov_crawler/scrapy_scheduler.py) - Process that manages and runs spider crawls based on a schedule.

* [Sitemap Monitor](search_gov_crawler/run_sitemap_monitor.py) - Process that monitors domains for changes in their sitemaps and triggers spider runs to capture changes.

* [DAP Extractor](search_gov_crawler/dap_extractor.py) - Stand-alone job that handles extracting and loading DAP visits data for use in spider crawls.

* [Benchmark](search_gov_crawler/benchmark.py) - Allows for manual testing and benchmarking using similar mechanisms as scheduled runs.
